# CSE_210_BYUI
<hr>
This is a repository to organize and share the programs created while taking the course "CSE 210: Programming with classes". <br>
Principles of object oriented programming will be applied through the projects. <br>
All the code is created by me. Please do not copy the code to save time as a student, it is better to create it yourself.  <br>

The course has a 14-week structure, each week is teaching new concepts to apply and combine them with the previous' week concepts. </p>
