- A function that’s part of a class is a method. Everything you learned about
functions applies to methods as well

- Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes self, which is
a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to
the attributes and methods in the class.

- Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in 
the class, and we’ll also be able to access these variables through 
any instance created from the class.

- Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance.

- To access the attributes of an instance, you use dot notation.
